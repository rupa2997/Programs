TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAY:-

1.They are arranged in rectangular grid of row and column .The elements of 2 dimensional array can be accessed using row subscript and column
  subscript.It is popularly known as matrix.

2.The general form of declaring 2d array is 

	<data type> <arr_name>[row_size][col_size];--> Here Column specifier is compulsory
	
	int arrary1[2][3]-->array1 integer of 2 rows and 3 columns
	float arrary2[5][1]-->array2 is a float array of 5 rows and 1 columns
	char[3][3]-->array3 is a character array of 3 rows and 3 columns. 

3.The array locations are initialized row wise, if init list is less than number of elements in the array then remaining element are init to  	zero
	eg:- int array1[4][7]={2,1,2,3,4,5,6,1,6,8}
	
	     2 1 2 3 4 5 6 			
	     1 6 8 0 0 0 0	
	     0 0 0 0 0 0 0
	     0 0 0 0 0 0 0	  	

4.2D array which are actually stored in memory which is linear hence multidimensional is to be stored one dimensional,they are 2 ways 
	
	+Row major order->Here elements are stored row wise.In C language mult dimensional array are stored in memory using row major order 				  of storage  
	+Column major order->Here the elements are stored column wise.Fortran and matlab are the examples.
	


+Command line arguments 

1. Array of character pointers --> char *languages[]={"BASIC","JAVA","FORTRAN","C","C++"}

2.We have seen that inputs are given to functions by means of argument , main is also the function so we provide the arguments to main 
  functions which can be done with the help of command line argument.

	main(int argc,char* argv[],char* envp[])
	{

	}

	argc-->argc is  count 
	argv-->argv is argument vector and is array of character pointers 
	envp-->environment variable pointer (Dynamic object containing editable value which can be used for software programs)


	suppose we have provided i/p as 
	prog opt1 opt2 sfile dfile

	+Command line arguments are separated by blank spaces
	+Name of the program will be the first argument so argc will count the number of arguments which will give you 5.
	
	+The contents are 
	
	argv[0]-->prog
	argv[1]-->opt1
	argv[2]-->opt2
	argv[3]-->sfile
	argv[4]-->dfile
