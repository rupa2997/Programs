STRUCTURES

+Strucutres is collection of variables under a single name and provide the convinient way of grouping several pieces of related information
together.
+Unlike the array it can be used to store the hetrogeneous data

	Defining Structure:-
		struct [Structure name]
		{
			type member_name1
			type member_name2 
		}variable_name

		struct book
		{
			char title[25];
			char author[20];
			int pages;
			float price;		
		}

+Structure defination does not reserve any memory space for strucuture members.

+Structure defination does not contain a structure tag-name created structure is unnamed, unnamed structure is also called anonymous structure 
		struct
		{
			char title[20];
			char author[20];
			int pages;	
			float price;
		
		}book1;

UNIONS

+UNION are used to create user-defined types ,it is collection of one or more variables possibly of different types 
+In structure separate memory is allocated to the structure while in union all the members of object share the same memory

		 	Defining Union:-

			union [union name]
			{
				type member_name1
				type member_name2 
			}variable_name
