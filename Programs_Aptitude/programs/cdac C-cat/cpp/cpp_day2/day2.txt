Data member - also called field,property,attribute
Member function - methods , operations, behaviour, message



















Diffrance between class and struct in cpp is - all the members of class is by default private and all the members of struct in cpp is by default public.




























class - User define data type.
Object -variable of class is called object
	object gets physical memory.


"class" as a blueprint of object






















characteristics of object
1.State - determined by the value of data member
2.Behavior- member function decides behavior of object.
Calling the same member function on two objects having diff state will show diff behavior.
3.Identity- every object has a characteristic that makes the object unique. In cpp every object has  unique address.






















Types of member function
Constructor
Destructor
Mutators/setter
inspector/getter
facilitator















Empty Class

	A class which do not have any Data member or member function is
called as the Empty class.

- We can create an object of a empty class.
- Size of an object of a empty class is 1 byte.


















Namespace
-used to avoid name ambiguity in case of globle variable,function,classes
-Logical grouping of variable , function, enum, structure, class, namespaces.
-to achive logical modularity














//printf
cout - object of ostream class declared in iostream inside std namespace
	It uses << operator called as insertion operator






//scanf
cin - object of istream class declared in iostream inside std namespace
	It uses >> operator called as extraction operator













Complex class
	data member 		real , imaginary
	member functions	complex(),complex(int r,int i),accept(),print()
				~complex()
