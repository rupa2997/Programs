Day 1


/*Assignment -2 program number - 8

Write a program that will calculate the price for a quantity entered from the keyboard,
given that the unit price is Rs 5 and there is a discount of 10 percent for quantities
over 30 and a 15 percent discount for quantities over 50.*/










Language classification
procedure oriented PL-C,pascal
object oriented PL - c++, java, c#, python
object based PL - VB























History:

@1960 OOP <--designed by Alen Kay 

@1960 <-- simula is first oop lang designed by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard

@1979 <-- Bjarne Stroustrup develop 'C with classes' (cfront) to improve the exe speed

@1983 <-- c++ (rename 'C with classes') with added features.















default Arguments - 	The arguments that are provided by the programmer in case,
  			user do not provide any values
			-default arg should be given from R to L















Inline functions - replaced at their call by compiler for faster execution
main() never declared as inline











Function overloading - same name and diff signature of function
			- Name mangling process , mangled name
			- Differ in number of input arguments
			- Differ in datatype of input arguments
			- Differ atleast in the sequence of the input arguments
-Return data type is not consider in  Function Overloading
-By using Function Overloading we can achive polymorphism in c++.

Access specifire- defines the accessibility of data member,Member functions

Private - Can access inside the same struct/class in which it is declared
	  Generally data members should declared as private.
public -  Can access inside the same struct/class in which it is declared as well as 		  inside out side function(like main()). 
	  Generally member functions should declared as public.











"this" Pointer
->When we call member function using object/vari implicitily one parameter 
is passed to that function is called as "this" pointer.
->"this" is a keyword in cpp
->"this" pointer always stores address of current object/vari or calling 
object.
->thus every member function of  class/struct refer this pointer which is a 1st
parameter of member function.
->this is a constant pointer.
